# Klip — Test Phases

> **Why this exists:** Klip has a complex two-process Electron architecture (main + renderer),
> stateful Zustand stores with undo/redo history, FFmpeg integration, IPC boundaries, and a
> virtualized timeline. Subtle bugs at any layer reach users as hard crashes. This document
> defines every test layer so issues are caught before they ship.
>
> **Design rule:** Every bug that has already shipped gets a permanent regression test.
> Every public-facing function gets at least one unit test. Components test behavior,
> not implementation.

- [ ] `deserializeProject(json)` restores identical `tracks`, `clips`, and `transitions`
- [ ] Serialized format includes a `version` field
- [ ] Deserializing a project from a missing optional field (e.g. no `markers`) does not crash
- [ ] Deserializing a project with an unknown field ignores it gracefully
- [ ] Deserializing a project with a wrong `type` for a field throws a descriptive error (not a silent wrong state)
- [ ] An empty project (no clips) serializes and deserializes to the same empty state

### 1.9 Property-based tests — timeline math invariants (~12 tests)

> Uses **fast-check** to generate arbitrary valid inputs and assert mathematical laws.
> These catch edge cases that hand-picked examples never think to try.

**`splitClip` invariants** (for any valid playhead in `(startTime, startTime + duration)`)
- [ ] `left.duration + right.duration === original.duration` (no time is gained or lost)
- [ ] `left.startTime === original.startTime`
- [ ] `right.startTime === original.startTime + left.duration`

**`addClip` / `removeClip` count invariant**
- [ ] For any sequence of N `addClip` calls followed by N `removeClip` calls with valid IDs, `clips.length` returns to its original value

**`undo` / `redo` round-trip invariant**
- [ ] For any sequence of actions, `undo()` then `redo()` returns to the same clips snapshot (deep equality)
- [ ] `past.length` never exceeds 50 regardless of how many actions are performed (bounded by property test with 100 actions)

**`pasteClips` ID uniqueness invariant**
- [ ] After any number of consecutive pastes, all clip IDs in the store remain unique (no duplicates)

## Phase 2 — Unit: Zustand Store Actions (~90 tests) ✅ IMPLEMENTED

> Construct store instances directly. Assert state transitions synchronously.
> No DOM, no IPC, no React.
> **Files:** `src/tests/stores/simple-stores.test.ts` (35 tests) · `src/tests/stores/timeline-store.test.ts` (77 tests) · `src/tests/stores/media-project-stores.test.ts` (33 tests) · 145 store tests, 169 total passing.

### 2.1 `timelineStore` — clip lifecycle (~25 tests)

- [ ] `addClip(clip)` → clip appears in `clips`
- [ ] `addClip` pushes one entry to `past` (undo history)
- [ ] `addClips([a, b])` → both clips added in one history entry (single undo reverts both)
- [ ] `removeClip(id)` → clip removed; missing id is a no-op (no crash)
- [ ] `removeSelectedClips()` → all clips in `selectedClipIds` are removed
- [ ] `moveClip(id, time)` → `startTime` updated; negative time clamped to 0
- [ ] `moveClipOnly(id, time)` → updates position without pushing to history
- [ ] `moveClips([{id, newStart}])` → all clips moved in one history entry
- [ ] `trimClip(id, patch)` → updates `trimStart` and `duration` correctly

- [ ] `rippleDeleteSelected()` → all selected clips ripple-deleted in one undo step
- [ ] After ripple delete, no clip has a negative `startTime`
- [ ] Ripple delete on a clip at time 0 shifts no clips (nothing is to the right at a negative position)

- [ ] Pasting after moving the playhead inserts at the new position
- [ ] `pasteClips()` with empty clipboard → no-op
- [ ] Pasted clips are added to `selectedClipIds` (they become the new selection)

### 2.5 `timelineStore` — undo/redo (~12 tests)

- [ ] `undo()` restores the previous `clips` snapshot
- [ ] `undo()` on empty `past` → no-op (no crash)
- [ ] `undo()` moves the undone state to `future`
- [ ] `redo()` re-applies the undone state
- [ ] `redo()` on empty `future` → no-op
- [ ] Any new action after `undo()` clears `future` (cannot redo after branching)
- [ ] 51 consecutive actions → `past` is capped at 50 (oldest entry dropped)
- [ ] `undo()` after `splitClip` fully reverses the split (original clip restored, new clips gone)
- [ ] `undo()` after `rippleDelete` restores all shifted clips to their original positions
- [ ] `undo()` after `pasteClips` removes all pasted clips atomically
- [ ] `undo()` after `addClips([a,b])` removes both clips in one undo step

> Mount via a minimal wrapper component. Mock `window.api` and Zustand stores.
> **File:** `src/tests/hooks/hooks.test.tsx`

- [x] Hook is stable — mounting does not immediately mark the project dirty
- [x] A timeline change after 500ms (after the liveness guard) sets `hasUnsavedChanges === true`
- [x] A timeline change within the first 500ms does NOT set `hasUnsavedChanges`

- [ ] Dropping an image file creates a clip only on the video track (duration 5s default)
- [ ] Dropping a music file creates a clip only on the `m1` track
- [ ] Dropping a color clip creates a video track clip with no linked audio
- [ ] Media bin "already on timeline" checkmark is driven by `timelineStore.clips` having a matching `mediaClipId`

### 4.2 Project save/load cycle (~12 tests)

- [ ] `undo()` after trimming a clip + moving a clip (two actions) reverts both independently
- [ ] `undo()` in `mediaStore` does not interfere with `timelineStore` undo stack
- [ ] Undo history is bounded at 50 entries; 51st action drops the oldest
- [ ] `redo()` works correctly after a sequence of undo steps

- [ ] `setWhatsThisMode(true)` activates "What's this?" hover tooltips globally
- [ ] `whatsThisMode` indicator is shown in the toolbar when active
- [ ] `toastStore.toast(message)` adds a toast entry
- [ ] Toast entry auto-removes after `duration` ms
- [ ] Showing a toast while another is visible does not crash the toast stack

### 4.5 `appSettingsStore` + `TutorialOverlay` interaction (~5 tests)

---

### 5.11 IPC surface / contract tests (~10 tests)

> Verify that every channel exposed in `preload/index.ts` has a registered handler in main,

## Phase 8 — Functional Tests ✅ IMPLEMENTED (57 tests across 7 files)

> **Tool:** Playwright + `_electron` launcher. Tests launch the real Electron app from `out/main/index.js`.
> Run `npm run build` first, then `npm run test:e2e`.
>
> **Files:**
> - `e2e/fixtures.ts` — shared ElectronApplication + Page fixtures
> - `e2e/helpers.ts` — dialog mocks, store injection, navigation helpers
> - `e2e/8.1-project.spec.ts` — project lifecycle (8 tests)
> - `e2e/8.2-media.spec.ts` — media import (10 tests)
> - `e2e/8.3-timeline.spec.ts` — timeline editing (18 tests)
> - `e2e/8.4-playback.spec.ts` — playback (8 tests)
> - `e2e/8.5-shortcuts.spec.ts` — keyboard shortcuts (9 tests)
> - `e2e/8.6-export.spec.ts` — export (6 tests)
> - `e2e/8.7-text-overlays.spec.ts` — text overlays (6 tests)
>
> **Source additions for testability:**
> - `window.__klipStores` — exposes Zustand stores for `page.evaluate()` state injection
> - `data-testid="project-name"` on TitleBar project name span
> - `data-testid="track-lane-{type}"` on each TrackRow clip lane
> - `data-testid="timeline-clip"` + `data-clip-id` on TimelineClipView root

## Phase 9 — Performance Tests (~15 tests) ✅ IMPLEMENTED (15 tests, 9 todo)

> Benchmark critical hot paths. Set pass/fail thresholds.
> **File:** `src/tests/performance/perf.test.ts`
> Hardware-dependent tests (FFmpeg, Electron launch) registered as `it.todo`.

### 9.1 Timeline rendering

- [ ] **Bench**: Adding 100 clips renders in < 100ms total (initial layout)
- [ ] **Bench**: Scrolling 500px horizontally on a 100-clip timeline completes a single rAF in < 16ms
- [ ] **Bench**: Zooming the timeline (pxPerSec change) triggers no more than 2 re-renders of `Timeline`
- [ ] **Bench**: `splitClip` store action completes in < 2ms
- [ ] **Bench**: `rippleDelete` on a 100-clip track completes in < 5ms

### 9.2 Media processing

- [ ] Thumbnail generated for a 1-minute 1080p clip in < 5 seconds
- [ ] Waveform peaks calculated for a 10-minute MP3 in < 10 seconds
- [ ] Waveform cache hit returns data in < 50ms

### 9.3 Playback

- [ ] Seek (scrub bar drag) updates preview within one rAF (~16ms) of pointer move
- [ ] Switching from one timeline clip to the next during playback takes < 200ms to load new source
- [ ] 60-second continuous playback of a 1080p clip shows no dropped frames in preview

### 9.4 Export

- [ ] A 1-minute 1080p timeline exports in < 3 minutes on target hardware
- [ ] Progress events fire at least once per second (UI does not appear frozen)
- [ ] Export memory usage does not grow unboundedly (no leak in progress event handler)

### 9.5 App startup

- [ ] Cold launch to welcome screen in < 3 seconds
- [ ] Reopening a project with 50 clips (including waveform cache) in < 5 seconds

## Phase 10 — Security Tests (~12 tests)

> Electron-specific attack surface. Run once before each public release.

- [ ] `contextIsolation: true` is set in `BrowserWindow` webPreferences
- [ ] `nodeIntegration` is `false` or not set (defaults to false) — renderer cannot call `require()`
- [ ] `sandbox: false` is intentional for preload; documented; preload does not expose raw `ipcRenderer`
- [ ] Preload `window.api` only exposes the specific IPC methods defined in `preload/index.ts` — no extra surface
- [ ] `shell.openExternal` is called only with URLs that begin with `https://` or `http://` (no `file://` or `javascript:`)
- [ ] FFmpeg is invoked with a hard-coded binary path (not a user-supplied path without validation)
- [ ] Exported file path is inside the user-chosen directory — test with a traversal payload (`../../../evil.mp4`) and assert it is rejected or sanitized
- [ ] No project file content is logged to `console.log` in production builds
- [ ] `webSecurity: false` is limited to renderer loading `klip://` protocol files — no remote content loaded
- [ ] The `klip://` protocol handler only serves files from paths that the user explicitly imported (not arbitrary paths)
- [ ] Autosave file is written to `app.getPath("userData")` — not to a world-writable temp directory
- [ ] IPC channel names are not guessable / enumerable from the renderer beyond what `preload` exposes

---

## Phase 11 — Acceptance Tests (~30 tests)

> Final sign-off before each release. Validates complete user stories.

### Story 1 — First-time user onboarding

> "I installed Klip, launched it, and understood the UI within 5 minutes."

- [ ] Tutorial launches automatically on first run
- [ ] Tutorial spotlight correctly highlights each of the 7 target elements
- [ ] Tutorial card is never clipped by the window edge (card stays inside viewport)
- [ ] Tutorial can be exited at any step; app is fully functional afterward
- [ ] After completing tutorial, it does not reappear on next launch
- [ ] "Restart Tutorial" in Settings → App tab re-runs the tutorial from step 1
- [ ] Restarting tutorial does not lose any existing project data

### Story 2 — Core edit workflow

> "I imported footage, trimmed clips, added music, added a title card, and exported."

- [ ] Import 3 video files into Media Bin
- [ ] Drag all 3 to the Video 1 track in order
- [ ] Trim 2 seconds from the start of the first clip
- [ ] Split the second clip and delete the first half
- [ ] Import a music file into the Music Library; drag it to the Music track
- [ ] Lower music volume to 60%
- [ ] Add a text overlay ("My Video Title") over the first clip
- [ ] Export to MP4 1080p60; file is produced and plays correctly
- [ ] Exported video duration matches the timeline total duration

### Story 3 — Project persistence

> "I saved my project, closed Klip, reopened it, and everything was exactly where I left it."

- [ ] Save project with clips, trims, text overlays, and a transition
- [ ] Close and reopen Klip
- [ ] Project appears in recents list with correct name and timestamp
- [ ] Open from recents: all clips are at the correct positions
- [ ] Text overlays have the same text, font, and position
- [ ] Transitions are preserved
- [ ] Playhead is at time 0 (or last-saved position)
- [ ] `hasUnsavedChanges` is `false` immediately after opening

### Story 4 — Error recovery after crash

> "The app crashed mid-edit, but when I reopened it my work was mostly there."

- [ ] Auto-save fires within 2 minutes of making an edit
- [ ] Force-crash the renderer (trigger an error boundary) and reopen
- [ ] Crash recovery dialog is shown with "Restore" and "Discard" options
- [ ] "Restore" loads the autosaved state including the most recent edits
- [ ] "Discard" clears the autosave and starts fresh (no remnants)
- [ ] If autosave file is corrupted, the dialog shows a graceful error — no crash

---

## Phase 12 — Accessibility Tests ✅ IMPLEMENTED (20 tests in 1 file)

> **Tool:** `jest-axe` (axe-core wrapped for Vitest) + React Testing Library.
> Every rendered component must pass `expect(await axe(container)).toHaveNoViolations()`.
> Additional manual checks cover keyboard-only navigation and focus management.
>
> **File:** `src/tests/accessibility/a11y.test.tsx`

### 12.1 axe automated scans (~8 tests)

*Run `axe()` on the fully-rendered component and assert zero violations.*

- [x] `WelcomeScreen` — no axe violations
- [x] `TutorialOverlay` (step 1) — no axe violations
- [x] `ExportDialog` — no axe violations
- [x] `SettingsDialog` — no axe violations
- [x] `CommandPalette` — no axe violations
- [x] `ErrorBoundary` fallback UI — no axe violations
- [x] `ClipCard` — no axe violations
- [x] `TopToolbar` — no axe violations

### 12.2 Focus management (~6 tests)

- [x] Opening `CommandPalette` moves focus to the search input automatically (50ms setTimeout)
- [x] Closing `CommandPalette` (Esc) sets `isOpen` to false
- [x] `SettingsDialog` close button is keyboard-activatable (aria-label + Enter key)
- [x] `ExportDialog` close button is keyboard-activatable (aria-label + Enter key)
- [x] `TutorialOverlay` Skip button is focusable and activatable via keyboard
- [x] `ErrorBoundary` Reload Klip button is focusable

### 12.3 Keyboard navigation (~6 tests)

- [x] `TopToolbar` buttons are keyboard-accessible (Undo, Redo, Save have aria-label)
- [x] `CommandPalette` ArrowDown/ArrowUp moves active selection
- [x] `CommandPalette` Enter executes the active command and closes the palette
- [x] "What's This?" button has correct `aria-pressed` reflecting whatsThisActive state
- [x] `ClipContextMenu` renders interactive button elements
- [x] `TutorialOverlay` Next/Back buttons are focusable and keyboard-activatable

## Priority order

Start here — highest ROI first:

1. **Phase 6 (Regression)** — protect against every crash already shipped
2. **Phase 7 (Smoke)** — fast gate before every build; catches catastrophic regressions in minutes
3. **Phase 1 §1.1–1.8 (Unit: mediaUtils + signals + tutorialSteps)** — pure functions, zero mocking overhead
4. **Phase 1 §1.9 (Property-based)** — run alongside unit tests; catches timeline math edge cases exhaustively
5. **Phase 2 (Unit: timelineStore + all stores)** — the most-used code paths; every action verified; includes §2.10–2.14 for the five previously uncovered stores
6. **Phase 3 §3.1–3.9 (Components: TutorialOverlay, ErrorBoundary, TitleBar, WelcomeScreen)** — already broke twice each
7. **Phase 3 §3.10–3.24 (Components: TopToolbar, CommandPalette, ExportDialog, SourceClipViewer, WhatThisOverlay, TimelineRuler, WaveformCanvas, SettingsDialog, ColorClipDialog, MusicLibrary, Toaster, AppLayout)** — zero coverage today
8. **Phase 3 §3.21–3.23 (Hooks: useProjectIO, useWaveform, useProxyEvents)** — autosave and waveform bugs are hard to reproduce manually
9. **Phase 4 (Store integration)** — catches state management bugs before they surface in the UI
10. **Phase 5 §5.1–5.6 (IPC core: mediaHandlers, projectHandlers, exportHandlers)** — file I/O and FFmpeg are the highest-risk main-process code
11. **Phase 5 §5.7–5.11 (IPC extended: settingsHandlers, localFileProtocol, ffmpegExport unit, windowState, IPC contract)** — zero coverage today; IPC contract tests prevent silent main/renderer drift
12. **Phase 12 (Accessibility)** — after component tests are passing; run axe scans and keyboard nav tests together
13. **Phase 8 (Functional)** — manual checklist until E2E is wired; run before every beta release
14. **Phase 9 (Performance)** — once core features are stable
15. **Phase 10 (Security)** — before any public release beyond private beta
16. **Phase 11 (Acceptance)** — final sign-off gate before each versioned release
